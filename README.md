Money Mantra: An AI-Powered Financial Assistant
Project Overview
Money Mantra is full-stack AI financial assistant. It helps Indian users with tax estimates, financial advice, and education. We built and launched it during a 36-hour hackathon in June 2025, where it won first place. It was recognized for its strong technical design, practical use, and polished look.

The platform smoothly combines advanced AI with an easy-to-use interface. This makes it a powerful and accessible tool for managing personal finances in India.
